## Threads and when to use it
Linear conversation can get confusing when multiple people reacting to diffrent statments in time.
Even so you can figure out what is going on after a few minutes it better not to wast it.
- Always use `thread` to replay for a question. 
- Try to use `thread` for ideas or small topics.
- Help other build a habbit. post :cop: or 👎 when someone replied not in thread. 👍 when someone new followed the rule.
