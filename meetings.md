# Meetings and how to run them
**The best meeting is a no meeting or an email.** - That does not mean to write a bunch of paragraphs to the team and say that your job is done. With today's CDD,  nobody will read it. At best, some will scroll through it. As a result, all your effort of writing it will be wasted. And you will be asked to repeat yourself many times.

As a presenter or person who run meeting, your jobs starts days before the meeting and not finish right after that. It can be split into three essential parts. `Preparation`, `Execution` and `Follow-up`
