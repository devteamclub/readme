# Meetings and how to run them
**The best meeting is a no meeting or an email.** - That does not mean to write a bunch of paragraphs to the team and say that your job is done. With today's CDD,  nobody will read it. At best, some will scroll through it. As a result, all your effort of writing it will be wasted. And you will be asked to repeat yourself many times.

As a presenter or person who run meeting, your jobs starts days before the meeting and not finish right after that. It can be split into three essential parts. `Preparation`, `Execution` and `Follow-up`

## Preparation
- Have an agenda for the meeting (do not overload it, keep it within a one topic)
- Schedule a meeting for the team (as short as possible to cover the agenda). Never book a meeting longer than an hour. If a topic can't be cover in one shot, split it into parts with at last 2h break between them.
- Make sure all team members saw the invite, accepted and read the agenda one day before the meeting.
- Tools are ready. Place for notes, Share Screen, Mic and Camera,  two monitors, good internet (not mobile), a Quiet environment for duration of the meeting.

## Execution
- If it is your meeting, you are the Boss. Sometimes participants unintentionally  overtake your meeting, note that and kindly remind them who is the Boss.
- Lead the meeting. Pick one of the common strategy. Ask feedback after the meeting or during retrospective.
- Do not deviate from topic. If that happens, notice it. `see FAQ`
- Make sure someone writes notes of the meetings. Not who said what. But items that has been covered. Actions that need to be taken by the team.

## Follow-up
- Within an hour after the meeting, follow up with email outlining the notes or link to the `documentation hub` where the notes are located.
- Make sure you outline action items and setup time for it, or follow up reminders.

## FAQ
What if I have another meeting right after and don't have time to send follow up email?
- If you have back to back meetings that you are running. You're doing something wrong. Rethink your strategy of scheduling meetings. At least 15 min gaps should be between meetings. Still can't make it work? - You might simply have too much on your plate.
What if I noticed that the meeting got off-topic?
- After a few off-topic sentences, `participant should not feel been shut down`, softly remind to take a close look into it in a separate meeting. Offer to run it will quickly determine if this meeting should happen or just a though for now.
